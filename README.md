# "Moka machine" proof of concept

The idea behind this project is to implement fine control over the temperature profile while brewing coffee in a moka pot. I haven't ever even tried [moka pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot) coffee. Just feel curious about higher power electronics and induction heating in particular.

Some brief notes and pictures are collected in the âœ¨[log](log/README.md).
